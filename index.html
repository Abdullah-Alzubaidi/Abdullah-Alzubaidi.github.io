            <h3>Hangman</h3>
            <p>The Hangman game uses Java Swing framework for GUI components like frames, labels, text fields, 
                radio buttons, and buttons. It also leverages Java's built-in graphics by overriding the paint(Graphics g) method for custom drawing,
                displaying visual elements such as the spaceship and alien for incorrect guesses. 
                This combination creates an interactive and engaging experience for players.</p>
