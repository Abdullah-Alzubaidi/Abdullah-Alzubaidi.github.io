        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>As a software engineering student, I have hands-on experience in developing real-world deployable applications.
                Throughout my time in university and various projects, I've gained extensive programming skills in C++, Java, SQL, and Flutter.
                Understanding the software development life cycle and development processes comes naturally to me.
                Time management and problem-solving are among my strong suits, and I excel at communicating effectively with team members.
                I am determined to overcome challenges and perform well under high-pressure situations.
                I strongly believe that my skills and qualities would be valuable assets to your company.
                This internship opportunity presents an ideal platform for me to contribute to your organization and further enhance my programming abilities.
                My primary goal is to make the most of my talents in the field of software engineering.
