            <p>
                I am a software engineering student with experience in developing applications that can be deployed in the real world.
                I have had a great deal of programming experience in the university and projects.
                Most of my experience is in C++, Java, SQL, and Flutter, and I am familiar with the software development life cycle and development processes.
                
                I excel at time management and possess strong problem-solving skills, along with the ability to communicate effectively with team members.
                I am determined to overcome obstacles and can handle high-pressure situations.
                I believe that I would be an asset to your company. This internship would provide me with the ideal opportunity to assist your organization and expand my programming skills.
